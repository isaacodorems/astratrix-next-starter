# Astratrix - Next.js Starter Migration

This is a starter repository generated to migrate your static Astratrix site into a modern Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind project.

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000`

## Notes
- This scaffold includes a simple NewsPanel API at `/api/feeds/top` that returns placeholder JSON.
- Replace /public assets, environment-backed API keys, and expand components as needed.
